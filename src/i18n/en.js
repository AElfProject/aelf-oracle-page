  Introduce:
    'Protal uses the aelf mainnet as the entrance, and aims to build a decentralized oracle network to provide safe and reliable off-chain data for any blockchain smart contract developer',
  'Start Portal': 'Start Portal',
  Infrastructure: 'Reliable、flexible、transparent、and secure infrastructure',
  'Based on aelf mainnet': 'Removal of credit risk based on the aelf mainnet',
  'Based on aelf mainnet introduce':
    'All smart contracts of Protal are deployed on the shared sidechain of the aelf mainnet, which means that the working process of the oracle nodes and credit records will be recorded on the chain throughout, and reputation rankings and organizational autonomy system will be achieved based on it.',
  'Connect API': 'Connect to any existing API',
  'Connect API introduce':
    'Establish an intermediate layer between smart contracts and APIs, to help smart contracts call any API data, and to seamlessly connect all legacy systems and blockchains.',
  'Flexible aggregation method': 'Flexible aggregation method',
  'Flexible aggregation method introduce':
    'On aelf, users can customize the aggregation method and logic of the oracle node result set when sending a request to the oracle network, and directly use the aggregated data in the on-chain world',
  'Submit-disclose mechanism': '"Submit-Reveal" mechanism',
  'Submit-disclose mechanism introduce':
    'Oracle nodes need to submit off-chain data in two stages. The answers submitted in the first stage are encrypted. After enough oracle answers are collected and verified, all answers will be decrypted gradually to prevent Other oracle nodes eat empty pay',
  'Oracle nodes and organizational reputation system':
    'Oracle nodes and organizational reputation system',
  'Oracle nodes and organizational reputation system introduce':
    'accumulate credit for a single oracle node and organization based on the actual interaction history on the chain, and based on the reputation system',
  'What is Portal': 'what is Portal?',
  'Portal text':
    'Portal is a project based on the Oracle contract on the shared side chain of the aelf mainnet. It uses an industry-recognized and effective solution to provide a reliable off-chain data for all on-chain operations including Ethereum and aelf. Portal allows any organization and individual to apply to become an oracle node and to form a decentralized oracle autonomous network freely, based on this to empower multiple future developments of the blockchain.',
  'Become an oracle node of Portal': 'Become an oracle node of Portal',
  'Become an oracle node text':
    'We provide aelf and ethereum event listeners to support users to dynamically subscribe to aelf and ethereum network events. When the contract event is triggered, the message containing the event details will be broadcast to the message bus and then used by the back-end service，so that the combination of smart contract events and back-end microservices is realized. At the same time, we have implemented the necessary logic for processing off-chain data requests, such as querying and submitting data. In addition, users can also customize the processing logic for an event in it.',
  'Start building': 'Start Building',
  'Oracle contract mechanism': 'The working mechanism of the Oracle contract',
  'Oracle contract mechanism introduce':
    'The user or other contracts on the aelf shared sidechain send data requests to the Oracle contract, and the Oracle contract will then notify each oracle node or organization designated by the event, and the oracle nodes will query the data and submit the results to the Oracle on the chain. Contract, after the Oracle contract aggregates the result sets submitted by multiple oracle nodes, the aggregated data is used to call back the method specified by the user (or simply return the data).',
